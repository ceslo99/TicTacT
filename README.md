# Tic Tac T

Android game created in Android Studio.   
Created a Tic Tac toe game with Grid Layout and image buttons to be able to click on the screen and drop a yellow or red
token. 
Used array to keep track of players current positions and be able to display winner when 3 in row is achieved. 

# What I Learned

* Used image Views to create better UI (previous vesion used text 'x' and 'o')
* Animated images to appear to drop in screen
